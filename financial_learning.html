            <strong>What is a Credit Card?</strong>
            
        </h2>
            <p style="font-family: quicksand;">A credit card is a thin rectangular piece of plastic or metal issued by a bank or financial services company that allows cardholders to borrow funds with which to pay for goods and services with merchants that accept cards for payment.
            Credit cards impose the condition that cardholders pay back the borrowed money, plus any applicable interest, as well as
            any additional agreed-upon charges, either in full by the billing date or over time.</p> 
            
            <h2 class="h-primary3" style="font-family: arial;"><strong>How does a credit card work?</strong> </h2>
           
            <p style="font-family: quicksand;">Step 1: <br> Here’s the first step of how Credit Cards work. You have completed your purchases at your favourite store and
            use your Credit Card at the checkout counter. The storekeeper will swipe your card or insert it into a POS or point of
            sale machine. In most cases, the store will ask you to enter a PIN (personal identification number) to authenticate the
            transaction. <br><br>
            Step 2: <br> The machine reads the strip or chip (which contains information to identify the card) and sends the information
            along with the PIN to your issuing bank (for example, HDFC Bank if you have an HDFC Bank Credit Card). If everything
            looks all right (credit limit, identity, validity, etc.), the bank approves the purchase. <br> <br>
            Step 3: <br> If the transaction is approved, the machine prints a pair of charge slips or receipts – the retailer retains one
            and gives you the other copy. In rare cases, where a PIN is not required, the retailer will request you to sign a copy
            of the charge slip. <br><br>
            You are billed for the transaction in the next statement, and the retailer receives the money after a few days. The
            whole process works seamlessly on systems and technology provided by Visa or Mastercard. <br>
            
            This should answer the question of how do Credit Card payments work. Now let’s look at how a Credit Card can be used
            over the Internet.

            <h2 class="h-primary3" style="font-family: arial;"><strong>Credit Card Vs Debit Card</strong></h2>
            <p style="font-family: quicksand;">
            Credit cards offer you a line of credit that can be used to make purchases, balance transfers and/or cash advances and
            requiring that you pay back the loan amount in the future. When using a credit card, you will need to make at least the
            minimum payment every month by the due date on the balance. If the full balance for purchases is not paid off, interest
            charges will be applied. Interest charges will be applied from the date of the transaction for balance transfers and/or
            cash advances. <br><br>
            Debit cards offer you a convenient way to withdraw money directly from your checking account. This money is not a loan,
            and no interest is charged. You will not have to make any minimum monthly payments. However, you must be careful not to
            charge more money than you have available in your checking account. <br><br>

            <h2 class="h-primary3" style="font-family: arial;"><strong>Transactional And Fee Difference?</strong></h2>
            
            <p style="font-family: quicksand;">Credit cards may have an annual fee or an introductory annual fee associated with it. The fee amount depends on the card and can vary after an introductory period. If you make a late payment, you may be charged a late fee. Certain credit cards may also have other fees associated with them depending on the activity. These may include cash advance fees,
            balance transfer fees, and foreign transaction fees. <br><br>
            Most debit cards do not charge annual fees, they may carry overdraft fees if there are insufficient funds in the
            associated checking account. What makes debit cards convenient is that there are no monthly payments on a balance and
            consequently, no late fees.</p>
            
            <h2 class="h-primary3" style="font-family: arial;"><strong>Improving Your Credit Score.</strong></h2>
            
            <p style="font-family: quicksand;">Unlike debit cards, credit cards can be used to improve credit score . A credit card issuer will report each monthly payment that you make to the three credit reporting agencies. With every monthly bill that you pay, you will be
            contributing to the successful rating of your credit score. Regularly using credit cards responsibly allows you to build
            credit because it shows lenders that you can manage credit.</p>
            
            <h2 class="h-primary3" style="font-family: arial;"><strong>Managing Your finance with credit cards</strong></h2>
            
            <p style="font-family: quicksand;">Making credit card payments on time to lower the credit-debt ratio that you currently have will work to reduce your debt and improve your credit score. In managing your monthly credit card bill, it is vital to make at least the minimum monthly payment on or before the due date.</p>
